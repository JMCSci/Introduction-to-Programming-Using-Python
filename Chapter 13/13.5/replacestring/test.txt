professional to your colleagues when your camera is just a little sharper.
After using a unit for a little over a week, it’s easy to recommend to anybody who needs a new desktop Mac right now. It’s fast, capable, and reliable. It’s just your basic 
iMac, and beyond a tired design, there’s little wrong with that.
